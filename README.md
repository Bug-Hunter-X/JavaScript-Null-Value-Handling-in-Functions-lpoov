# JavaScript Null Value Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: improper handling of null values in function arguments.  The provided code snippet shows a correct implementation of handling null values to prevent errors.  Incorrect handling of null values can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.  This example highlights the importance of robust null checks in JavaScript functions.

## Code Description
The `bug.js` file contains the JavaScript code which demonstrates proper null value handling.  The `bugSolution.js` file contains the same code.  This is to show that this is a solution that works effectively and does not introduce any bugs.  The example function handles null values gracefully, returning `null` in those cases and performing addition only when both arguments are numbers.
